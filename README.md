# Q-Baller - A Spherical Wheeled Robot (Ballbot) Project
Latest Update: 2017/2/27

Greetings, this is Jiamin Wang, currently a MS student majored in Mechanical Engineering at University of Missouri - Columbia. My current research areas include control and robotics.The Q-Baller Project is my Master's Research Project.

Since 2005, there have been many spectacular Ballbot designs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot). While admiring the great works by the leading researchers, I attempt to develop a Ballbot which happens to be the proposed research topic by my graduate advisor. I started from design in fall 2015 (the start of my graduate study), and later accomplished the mechanical prototype manufacture, electronic system application, dynamic analysis, control study and the embedded system development.

2015/11: Completion of the Mechanical Structure Prototype;
2016/1: Completion of the Preliminary Electronic System Design;
2016/2: Completion of the Dynamic Modeling and Basic Control Study;
2016/4: Completion of the Preliminary Simulation HMI (Idea Presentation);
2016/6: Corrected previous mistakes made in modeling and established a more detailed dynamic model;
2016/7: Completion of the Preliminary Electronic System Prototype;
2016/8: Dynamic Modeling and Simulation of Q-Baller - A Spherical Wheeled Robot accepted by ASIAN MMS 2016 & CCMMS 2016;
2016/10: Completion of the Preliminary Embedded System;
2016/11: Preliminary Electronic System did not work well due to the complexity of the system (too much noise). Therefore, a new electronic system planing is carried out to design a integrated robotic circuitry board;
2016/12: Completion of the JMechW Robotic Board controller design;
2017/1: Completion of the Electronic System Update.
2017/2: Updated the embedded system and improvement

# Challenges
The challenges I am facing during the project includes:

1. The Q-Baller Project has no financial support. For this reason, I have cut down the material cost of prototyping (excluding manufacturing labor) to within 600 USD and handmade many of the components.
2. As the individual researcher for this project, I have to take care of everything in the Q-Baller development including aspects from ME, EE and CS. Engineering tasks have been kind of a burden, not to mention the demand
3. The research resources are limited - especially equipments, environments and technical helps.
