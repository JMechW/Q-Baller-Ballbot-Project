Greetings, this is Jiamin Wang, currently a MS student majored in Mechanical Engineering at University of Missouri - Columbia. My current research areas include control and robotics.The Q-Baller Project is my Master's Research Project.

Since 2005, there have been many spectacular Ballbot designs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot). While admiring the great works by the leading researchers, I attempt to develop a Ballbot which happens to be the proposed research topic by my graduate advisor. I started from design in fall 2015 (the start of my graduate study), and later accomplished the mechanical prototype manufacture, electronic system application, dynamic analysis, control study and the embedded system development.

# Challenges
The Q-Baller Project has not been an easy and smooth task. The main challenges I am facing includes:

1. The Q-Baller Project has no financial support. For this reason, I have cut down the material cost of prototyping (excluding manufacturing labor) to within 600 USD and handmade many of the components.
2. As the individual researcher for this project, I have to take care of everything in the Q-Baller development including aspects from ME, EE and CS.
3. The research resource is limited - equipments, environments and technical helps.
