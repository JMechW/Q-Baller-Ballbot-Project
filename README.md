# Q-Baller - A Spherical Wheeled Robot (Ballbot) Project
Latest Update: 2017/2/27

Greetings! This is Jiamin Wang, currently a MS student majored in Mechanical Engineering at University of Missouri - Columbia. My current research areas include control and robotics.The Q-Baller Project is my Master's Research Project.

Since 2005, there have been many spectacular Ballbot designs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot). While admiring the great works by the leading researchers, I attempt to develop a Ballbot which happens to be the proposed research topic by my graduate advisor. I started from design in fall 2015 (the start of my graduate study), and later accomplished the mechanical prototype manufacture, electronic system application, dynamic analysis, control study and the embedded system development.

# Special Features about Q-Baller
The Q-Baller uses 4 Omni-Wheel friction drive systems. DC Motor is used to cut down the prototype cost and to test the theoretical possibility of accomplishing a low cost Ballbot without using Servo Motors.

The structure design adopts sheetmetal working techniques, resulting in a low manufacture cost.

Dynamic modeling is thorough which includes the characteristics of the DC motors. The inputs of the system are now Voltage, instead of torque which can be easily controlled if servo motors are adopted.

A contiunous gain-scheduled controller is designed for Q-Baller, which leads to some satisfying results.

Future works will include a more user-friendly and powerful HMI, experimentation of the application of advanced control methods and artificial intelligience algorithms.

# Challenges
The challenges I am facing during the project includes:

1. The Q-Baller Project has no financial support. For this reason, I have cut down the material cost of prototyping (excluding manufacturing labor) to within 600 USD and handmade many of the components.
2. As the individual researcher for this project, I have to take care of everything in the Q-Baller development including aspects from ME, EE and CS. Engineering workload has been kind of a burden.
3. The research resources are limited - equipments, environments and technical helps.

However, through challenges one can improve to a higher level and become tougher in life. After all, the project is fun so there is nothing really to complain about, haha.:)
