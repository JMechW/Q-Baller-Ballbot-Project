Greetings, this is Jiamin Wang, currently a MS student majored in Mechanical Engineering at University of Missouri - Columbia. The Q-Baller Project is my Master's Research Project.

Since 2005, many spectacular Ballbot designs (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ballbot) has emerged. While admiring the great works by the leading researchers, I attempt to develop a Ballbot which happens to be the proposed research topic by my graduate advisor. I started from design in fall 2015, and later accomplished the mechanical prototype manufacture, electronic system application, dynamic analysis, control study and the embedded system development.
